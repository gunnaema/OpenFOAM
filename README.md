# OpenFOAM

Everything should be working as long as OpenFOAMv2312 is installed (or similar)
Simply write ./Allrun in the terminal. If access is denied use chmod +x ...(command)
./Allclean clean previous simulations. The mesh is made slightly coarser and the max courant number is also slightly higher, to make the simulations run a little faster. :-)
